I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Science, Western University. My research interests include graph neural networks, transfer learning, and their application.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Boyu Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/borriewang/home?authuser=0) and [Prof. Charles Ling](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/~xling/) (Fellow, Canadian Academy of Engineering). Before studying at Western, I received my B. Eng. degree in Software Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). My undergraduate research advisor is [Prof. Zhao Kang](https://zhaokang.site/).
